### Setup

1. **Download Scryfall Bulk Data** (Required)
   - Go to [Scryfall Bulk Data](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data)
   - Download the **"Oracle Cards"** JSON file (recommended, ~50MB)
   - **Note**: "All Cards" file (~200MB) may exceed browser memory limits
   - Place the downloaded JSON file in `wwwroot/Scryfall/` directory
   - Rename the file to `oracle-cards.json` or update the filename in `ScryfallDataService.cs`
   - The file is NOT included in the repository (users must download it themselves)

2. **Important Limitations**
   - Blazor WebAssembly runs entirely in the browser
   - Very large JSON files (>100MB) may cause memory issues
   - Recommended: Use "Oracle Cards" (~50MB) instead of "All Cards" (~200MB)
   - The "Oracle Cards" file contains unique card faces, which is sufficient for most use cases

3. **Build & Run**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```
